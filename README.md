|Paper|Idea|
|-|-|
|**DNS Cache Poisoning Attack Reloaded: Revolutions with Side Channels (CCS '20)**|Side Channel: ICMP message rate limit; used for UDP port scanning|
|*Principled Unearthing of TCP Side Channel Vulnerabilities (CCS '19)*|Automatic detection of non-interface vulnerabilities in TCP connections|
|*Off-Path TCP Exploits: Global Rate Limit Considered Dangerous (Sec '16)*|Side channel: ACK count; used for TCP resetting attacks (send sproofed ACK packets so that the server resets the connection with victims)|
|**Cross Layer Attacks and How to Use Them (for DNS Cache Poisoning, Device Tracking and More) (S&P '21)**|Side channel: prandom PRNG; used to predict future random number used for UDP port randomization|
|*Injection Attacks Reloaded: Tunnelling Malicious Payloads over DNS (Sec '21)*|Injecting malicious payload into DNS responses, causing victim machine to allow unauthenticated network access|
|*Zombie Awakening: Stealthy Hijacking of Active Domains through DNS Hosting Referral (CCS '20)*|Attacking domains with vulnerable state NS records|
|**The Maginot Line: Attacking the Boundary of DNS Caching Protection**|Attacking DNS forwarder (with much lower security level) in CDNS systems|
|*Unveiling your keystrokes: A Cache-based Side-channel Attack on Graphics Libraries (NDSS '19)*|Side channel: Graphic library's time of rendering different texts; can be used to infer user input|
|*Mind the Portability: A Warriors Guide through Realistic Profiled Side-channel Analysis (NDSS 20')*|Side channel: Voltage of the victim machine; machine learning based approach for profiling attack|
